# Python_portfolio
Hello!
These were my first small projects in Python. Reading CSV files, cleaning and manipulating data with regular expressions, creating visualisations, learning to handle dictionaries, lists and so on. As of today, I am better versed in the language, but you can see my humble beginning.
Always happy to receive feedback and keep on learning.
